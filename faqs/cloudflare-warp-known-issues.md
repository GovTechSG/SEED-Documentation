# Cloudflare WARP FAQ

<details open>
<summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">What should I do if I am unable to browse the internet using Cloudflare WARP?</summary>

Check if you are connected to any VPN. If you are still connected to your VPN, you may not be able to access the internet as it conflicts with your DNS resolver configuration. To resolve this, disconnect from your VPN and make sure only Cloudflare WARP is connected.

<details open><summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">I had to use my VPN and as recommended by SEED, I had turned off Cloudflare WARP and connected to VPN. After three hours, when Cloudflare WARP automatically reconnects, I am unable to browse the internet. What could be the reason and how to resolve it?</summary>

If you disconnect Cloudflare WARP on your device, it gets automatically reconnected after three hours. At that time, if you are still connected to your VPN, you may not be able to access the internet as it conflicts with your DNS resolver configuration.

To resolve this, disconnect the device from your WiFi and reconnect it to your WiFi to reset the DNS resolver settings or restart your device.

In addition, make sure the VPN configuration does not route all traffic and DNS queries to the VPN server. Our recommendation is not to turn on WARP and the VPN at the same time.

<summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">I am unable to access a particular website. I get an <em>Access restricted</em> error or <em>DNS error</em> while accessing this website.</summary>

The following can cause this issue:

- Gateway may have blocked these sites as WARP works with Cloudflare Gateway to block websites that are identified as malware sources or a security risk as per our security policy.

- DNS resolution for the website may fail because of WARP and Gateway.

*To resolve gateway issues for trusted sites*

1. Turn off WARP.
2. Ensure Microsoft Defender is running to protect your device against malware.

?> Note WARP connection will automatically reconnect after three hours.

<summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">While using some tools and applications with Cloudflare WARP Client, why do I get SSL errors?</summary>

Your tool or application may be using a certificate store that is separate from the trusted root certificate store of your system.

  1. Download the Cloudflare CA certificate to your root system store(s) from the [Cloudflare documentation page][install-cloudflare-cert-operating-system].
  2. Refer to your CLI tool documentation and configure it to trust the Cloudflare root certificate.
  3. You can also refer to the following links for instructions to configure your tool or application:
     * [GovTech instructions for commonly used CLI tools across Singapore
       Government developers][config-cli-tools-with-warp], or
     * [Cloudflare instructions for configuring commonly used developer CLI
       tools][install-cloudflare-cert-applications].

<summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">I am unable to access the GCC 2.0 Cloud Management Portal, or a Singapore Tech Stack service. Is there a problem with my Government Managed Device?</summary>

If you are unable to access the GCC 2.0 CMP or any SGTS service, do the following:

1. Confirm the following:
    - If you have received the successfully onboarded email from DEEP.
    - If you are using only the [supported browsers](additional-resources/best-practices).
    - Ensure that Cloudflare WARP client is updated to the latest version and is connected. Go to Cloudflare WARP **Settings**, and ensure that **Gateway with WARP** is selected.
    - If Tanium is listed in the **Start** menu for Windows and in **Finder** > **Applications** for macOS.
    - If your device operating system is updated to the latest version.
    - If Defender is up-to-date and in the running state.
    - If your TechPass account has the required permissions to access the GCC 2.0 CMP or a particular SGTS service.

2. Make sure the VPN configuration does not route all traffic and DNS queries to the VPN server. Our recommendation is not to turn on WARP and the VPN at the same time.

If you still have issues, [Generate diagnostic report](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/#/faqs/how-to-generate-and-upload-diagnostic-files-to-incident-support-request) and upload it to the [incident support request][raise-support-request].

  <summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Can I request to include IP addresses or domains in the Cloudflare WARP split tunnel list to exclude them from going through WARP and redirect them to go though other VPN?</summary>

  Currently, we do not accept requests for split tunnel or fallback domain entries because from a security compliance perspective, it would allow endpoints to access other VPN networks and act as a network bridge. If you want to connect to other VPN networks, turn off Cloudflare WARP temporarily. Note that Cloudflare WARP when manually turned off, will be automatically turned on after three hours.
