?> Note: If you are a public officer, ensure that you have an email address belonging to the gov.sg domain. For example, *your_name<span>@</span>tech.gov.sg* or *your_name<span>@</span>mof.gov.sg*. Henceforth, this document will refer to this as your WOG ID.

**Audience**: Public Officers

?> Note: SEED is supported by Non-GSIB devices that run on Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise, or macOS Catalina 10.15 and above.
