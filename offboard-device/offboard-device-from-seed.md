# Offboard device from SEED

We have now automated most of the offboarding steps to simply the process. There are two steps to this new offboarding process. 

In the first step, you identify your Defender organisation to download the appropriate script. When you run the script, it unenrolls your device from the SEED components and resets some of the configuration settings that were modified during SEED onboarding. When you successfully complete this, you are directed to the second step. 

In the second step, you need to submit the Intune Devcie ID. We complete your device offboarding from the server-side and notify you.

?>**Note**<br>By default, the Intune Device ID is auto-retrieved for you. If it is not displayed on this form, follow the guidelines on the form to get your Intune Device ID.
