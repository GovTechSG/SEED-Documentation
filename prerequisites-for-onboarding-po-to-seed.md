# Prerequisites for onboarding Public Officers to Security suite for Engineering Endpoint Devices (SEED)

Objective: This document provides the prerequisites for onboarding Public Officers to SEED.

?> Tip: If you are a Public Officer, you will have an email address belonging to the gov.sg domain. For example, *your_name*@tech.gov.sg or *your_name*@mof.gov.sg. Henceforth, this document will refer to this as your WOG ID.

Audience: Public Officers

?> Note: SEED is supported by **Non-GSIB** devices that run on Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise, or macOS Catalina 10.15 and above.

Following are the prerequisites for onboarding Public Officers to SEED:

1. A WOG account with [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/Proofup.aspx) is required before you can sign in to SEED-related services.

2. An active TechPass account that is linked to your WOG ID. If you do not have one, visit [Create TechPass account](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-documentation/#/onboard?id=public-officer) to create a TechPass account.

?> Note: This TechPass account uses the same username and password as that of your WOG ID and hence acts as a single sign-on.

3. [Configure your macOS for a clean onboarding](Pre-onboarding-clean-up-instructions-for-macos) or [Configure your Windows for a clean onboarding](Pre-onboarding-clean-up-instructions-for-windows)

 Now you may proceed to [Onboard using macOS](seed-onboarding-instructions-for-macos) or [Onboard using Windows](seed-onboarding-instructions-windows)
