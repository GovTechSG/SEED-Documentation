# Offboard device from SEED

We have now automated most of the offboarding steps to simplify the process. This new offboarding method consists of **only two steps**. 

In the first step, you identify your Defender organisation to download the appropriate offboarding script. When you run this offboarding script on your device, it:

- unenrolls your device from the SEED components such as Intune, Tanium, Defender and Cloudflare WARP. 
- resets some of the configuration settings that were modified during SEED onboarding.

When you complete this step, you are directed to the second step, where you submit a request to us to remove the device record from the server side.

When we delete your device record from the server side, the DEEP team notifies you about your successful offboarding.
