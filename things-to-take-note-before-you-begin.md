## Things to take note before you begin

- After you complete the onboarding process, you will receive an email confirming your successful onboarding to SEED and your device will be automatically renamed and restarted.
- After the automatic restart, Mac users will be prompted to reset their password to enforce a strong password policy.
- If a device onboarded to SEED is compromised or lost, the respective agency may remotely wipe the device, including any personal information.
