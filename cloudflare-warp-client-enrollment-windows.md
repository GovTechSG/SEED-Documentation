**Connecting to other VPNs apart from WARP:**

- The WARP client connects your device to the Cloudflare network, which functions like a VPN.
- If you need to connect to another VPN, please **disconnect from WARP** AND **exit the WARP client** before doing so.
- Exiting the WARP client is needed because by default the WARP client will attempt to **automatically reconnect every hour,** which will affect your existing VPN connection.
