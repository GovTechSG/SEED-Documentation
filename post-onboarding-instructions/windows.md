**Enrol in Cloudflare using WARP client to access protected engineering resources**

1. Click the **Show hidden icons** arrow next to the notification area and make sure that Cloudflare WARP icon is displayed on your device or go to the **Start** menu and search for **Cloudflare WARP**.

?> If it is not available on your device, install it from [Cloudflare App Center](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/cloudflare/apps/1.1.1.1-windows-1/distribution_groups/release).

2. Disconnect from any other VPN that might be running as that could clash with Cloudflare.

3. Run the Cloudflare WARP client. You will see an information page, followed by a privacy policy.

4. Click **Next** and accept the policy.

5. Sign on using your TechPass credentials.

6. Approve your TechPass login using the authenticator app that was used to set up TechPass MFA. However, if you are a public officer, you must first approve your WOG login before approving your Techpass login.

?> The WARP client connects your device to the Cloudflare network, which functions like a VPN. If you want to connect to a different VPN, first disconnect from WARP and exit it before doing so. If you do not exit the WARP client, it will attempt to automatically reconnect after three hours and this may affect your existing VPN connection.
