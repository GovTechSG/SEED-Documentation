## Things to take note before you begin

- After you complete the SEED onboarding process, you will receive an email confirming your successful onboarding and your device will be automatically renamed.
- Restart your device when prompted. Mac users will be prompted to reset their password to enforce a strong password policy.
- If a device onboarded to SEED is compromised, lost or if the owner of the device changes, the respective agency may remotely wipe the device, including any personal information.
