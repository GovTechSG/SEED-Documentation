# Prerequisites for onboarding public officers into Security suite for Engineering Endpoint Devices (SEED)

This document provides instructions for onboarding into SEED as a public officer. For avoidance of doubt, this means that you have an **email address belonging to the gov.sg domain** (e.g. your_name@tech.gov.sg or your_name@mof.gov.sg). This document will henceforth refer to this email address as your **WoG ID.**

Do note that SEED is meant for **Non-GSIB devices** only, so please do not attempt to onboard your GSIB. We currently only support devices running **Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise** , or **MacOS Catalina 10.15 and above**.

## Prerequisites

1. Setting up 2FA for your WoG account

If you have not done so before, please follow the instructions at [**this link**](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/Proofup.aspx)to activate 2FA for your WoG account. This is required before you can sign in to SEED-related services using your WoG ID.

2. Creation and activation of TechPass account

You will need to create a TechPass account that is linked to your WoG ID. You can do so by following the instructions at [**this link.**](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-documentation/#/onboard?id=public-officer) Take note that **this TechPass account uses the same username and password as your WoG ID** by default, which means you will only need to remember one set of credentials.

3. Configure your device for a clean onboarding attempt

Onboarding to SEED will involve the installation and configuration of several pieces of software. In order to prevent any conflicts while attempting to onboard, you will need to configure your device for a clean onboarding attempt. Please follow all the relevant instructions provided **(2) SEED Pre-onboarding Clean-up Instructions (Windows).docx** and **(2) SEED Pre-onboarding Clean-up Instructions (MacOS).docx** respectively.

4. Onboard your device to SEED

Windows users should follow the onboarding instructions found at **(3) SEED Onboarding Instructions (Windows).docx**, while MacOS users should follow the instructions found at **(3) SEED Onboarding Instructions (MacOS).docx**. Please follow the instructions carefully to avoid complications during the onboarding process.
