5. Sign on using your TechPass credentials.

6. Approve your TechPass login using the authenticator app that was used to set up TechPass MFA. However, if you are a public officer, you must first approve your WOG login before approving your Techpass login.

<kbd>![techpass-sigin](images/cloudflare-warp-windows/techpass-sigin.png ':size=400')</kbd>

6. Once you have successfully signed in, click the Cloudflare WARP icon. You should see the following page.

<kbd>![after-signed-in](images/cloudflare-warp-windows/after-signed-in.png ':size=400')</kbd>


?> The WARP client connects your device to the Cloudflare network, which functions like a VPN. If you want to connect to a different VPN, first disconnect from WARP and exit it before doing so. If you do not exit the WARP client, it will attempt to automatically reconnect every hour and this may affect your existing VPN connection.

If your onboarding is successful, within an hour, you will receive a successfully onboarded email to your organisational email address.

?> If you do not receive this email, [check if Microsoft Defender is configured correctly](verify-microsoft-defender-is-configured-correctly-for-your-os) and also check if Tanium and Cloudflare are installed. If Tanium or Cloudflare is not installed, [raise a support request](raise-an-incident-support-request).

Shortly after this email, when you receive a desktop notification informing about the device name change and about the device being restarted, do the following:

1. Save your current work and restart your device.
2. If prompted to specify your password, enter it.
