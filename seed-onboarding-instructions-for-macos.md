<!--?> Onboarding is not yet complete. Now you proceed to verify if System Integrity Protection(SIP) is enabled on your device. SIP protects your system from the execution of unauthorised code.-->

## Ensure SIP is enabled on your device
Make sure SIP is enabled to prevent executions of unauthorised codes.

To verify if SIP is enabled, open **Terminal** and run the following command:

  ```
  csrutil status
  ```

 If the response on your **Terminal** is ``System Integrity Protection status: enabled``, it indicates that SIP is already enabled on your device.

 ?>  If it is currently disabled, run the command ``csrutil enable`` on the **Terminal** and restart your device before proceeding with the following steps.

## Ensure your device hard disk is encrypted
To protect the privacy of your files and user data secured, ensure your device hard disk is encrypted.

*To ensure your device hard disk is encrypted* :

1. Go to the **Apple** menu > **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy**.
2. Click the **FileVault** tab.
3. If you see **Turn on FileVault**, go to step 4 or proceed to [Enable Full Disk Access(FDA)](#enable-full-disk-access).

5. Click **Turn on FileVault**.
6. You will be prompted to specify how you would like to unlock your device if you forget your device password. Select **Create a recovery key and do not use my iCloud account**.

<kbd>![create-recovery-key](images/onboarding-for-macos/create-recovery-key-1.png)</kbd>

 ?>  Save this key on a different device.

<!--Note:

- Some applications that SEED depends on require Full Disk Access (FDA) in order to function.
