<summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Improved offboarding steps</summary>

We've developed an offboarding package (script) that automates the steps to offboard your device from SEED components. 

You'll then be directed to submit your Intune Device ID for us to remove your device record from the server side and notify you.

For more information, see [Offboard device from SEED](offboard-device/offboard-device-from-seed.md)
