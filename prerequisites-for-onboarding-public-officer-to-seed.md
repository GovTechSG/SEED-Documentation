2. An active [TechPass account](term-definitions)that is linked to your WOG ID. If you do not have one, [Create TechPass Account](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-documentation/#/onboard?id=public-officer) now.

?> Note: Use your WOG account credentials to log in to your TechPass account.

3. Ensure your team representative provides your TechPass ID (in this case it is your WOG ID) to gcc2.0_support@tech.gov.sg at least three working days before the day of onboarding.

4. [Get your macOS ready for onboarding](seed-pre-onboarding-clean-up-instructions-for-macos) or [Get your Microsoft Windows ready for onboarding](seed-pre-onboarding-clean-up-instructions-for-windows)

 Once the GCC2.0 team grants the required access to your TechPass account, and if you have completed step 4, proceed to [Onboard using macOS](seed-onboarding-instructions-for-macos) or [Onboard using Windows](seed-onboarding-instructions-windows).
