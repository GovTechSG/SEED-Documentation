**Customer Impact:** Users may have observed 500 errors while accessing the Internet and Cloudflare protected SGTS services using Cloudflare WARP.

While we monitor the fix, if you are still unable to access the Internet, please turn off WARP to access the Internet and raise an [incident support request](raise-an-incident-support-request) with the respective SGTS service or product team.

Newer version of Cloudflare Client will be installed on your GMD on July 01, 2022 18:00 SGT:
- version 2022.5.342 for macOS
- version 2022.5.341 for Windows

This newer version will fix the memory leak issue observed on the older Cloudflare clients.

**Customer Impact:** During the client upgrade, your GMD will be disconnected from the SGTS resources accessed at that time.

**Additional Information:** If you are unable to access SGTS services after the newer client version is installed, please reboot your GMD. If the issue persists, please [raise an incident support request](raise-an-incident-support-request) with the respective SGTS service or products team.
