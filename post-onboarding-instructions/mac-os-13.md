## Enrol with Cloudflare using WARP client

After onboarding to SEED, enrol your device with Cloudflare using WARP client to connect to protected engineering resources.

**To enrol with Cloudflare WARP:**

  1. Ensure that you have Cloudflare WARP client installed in your device. If not, install the latest [Cloudflare WARP](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/cloudflare/apps/1.1.1.1-macos-1/distribution_groups/release) version.

  2. Disconnect from any other VPN that might be running as that could clash with Cloudflare.

  3. Open the Cloudflare WARP client from the menu bar on the top right corner of your Mac device.

  ?> If you are a public officer, you need to authorise your WOG sign-in first. To authorise that, enter the six-digit one-time password code displayed under your SG Govt M365 account on your authenticator app and then proceed to authorise your TechPass account.

  ?> The WARP client connects your device to the Cloudflare network, which functions like a VPN. If you want to connect to a different VPN, first turn off WARP connection before connecting to other VPN network. WARP will be automatically turned on after three hours and this will affect your other VPN connections.
