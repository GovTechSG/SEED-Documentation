<summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Roll out of Egress Static IPs</summary>

This a long awaited feature. We have rolled out egress to all SEED users. While this feature does not affect the majority of SEED users, it improves the integration between SEED and some services that don't support integration with Cloudflare. If you have such a requirement to secure your environment, please get in touch with us through our SEED mailbox at [enquiries_seed@tech.gov.sg](mailto:enquiries_seed@tech.gov.sg).

<summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">Improved offboarding steps</summary>

We've developed an offboarding package (script) that automates the steps to offboard your device from SEED components. 

You'll then be directed to submit your Intune Device ID for us to remove your device record from the server side and notify you.
