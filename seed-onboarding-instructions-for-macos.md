# SEED onboarding guide for Mac users

This sections explains how public officers and vendors can onboard to SEED using their macOS device. Before onboarding, take a look at the [prerequisites for SEED onboarding](prerequisites-for-onboarding).


?>  Based on your Mac settings, you may be prompted to restart or reset your password while onboarding.
For a smooth onboarding journey, it is important to link your Apple ID to this Mac device. Generate a recovery key and keep it safe in a place other than the Mac device that you are going to onboard to SEED.

During this onboarding journey you will do the following:

If your onboarding is successful, within an hour, you will receive a successfully onboarded email to  your organisational email address.

Shortly after this email, you will receive a desktop notification informing you that your device has been renamed and will automatically restart in the next five minutes. When you log in again, you will be prompted to reset your password. This is to enforce a strong password policy.
