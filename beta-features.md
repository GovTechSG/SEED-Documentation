# Beta features 

:rainbow: Be the first to experience the new features in SEED. Share your ideas and feedback on the new feature with us to improve it for you!

Currently, when you need to offboard a device from SEED, you must manually offboard or uninstall from Defender, Cloudfalre WARP, Tanium Client and Intune. 

We have come up with a script which when executed automatically removes and offboards your device from the above-mentioned components automatically! To know more about it, see [Offboard device from SEED](offboard-device/offboard-device-from-seed.md).
